# Folder-to-MSI Github Actions Pipeline

Takes an app folder (.exe and data files) as a zip, and wraps it in MSI including a start menu shortcut

This is intended to serve as a testbed for you to make your own MSI, before you hook it up to your Github Actions pipeline

To start:

- "Use as template" to create your own repo
- Replace Folder.zip with your own folder
- Replace Icon.ico with your own icon
- Replace "YOUR" texts in app.wxs with your actual data
- Replace the "Unciv.exe" target in app.wxs with your executable name

Happy testing!
