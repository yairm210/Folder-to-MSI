# Folder-to-MSI Github Actions Pipeline

Takes an app folder (.exe and data files) as a zip, and wraps it in MSI including a start menu shortcut

To start:

- "Use as template" to create your own repo
- Replace Folder.zip with your own folder
- Replace Icon.ico with your own icon
- Replace "YOUR" tests in app.wxs with your data
- Replace "Unciv.exe" target with your executable

Happy testing!
